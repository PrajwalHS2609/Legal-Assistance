      <h2>The Legal Framework for Cyber Crimes in India</h2>{" "}
      <p>
        In India, cyber crimes are governed by several laws and regulations,
        including the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) and the Indian
        Penal Code (IPC). The IT Act is the primary legislation dealing with
        cyber crimes, and it covers a wide range of offenses, from hacking and
        identity theft to more severe crimes like cyber terrorism. Additionally,
        the IPC is used in conjunction with the IT Act to address traditional
        crimes that have been extended to the cyber domain, such as defamation,
        fraud, and harassment.
