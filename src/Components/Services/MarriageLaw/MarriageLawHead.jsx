      <p>
        There are several reasons why marriage registration is essential.
        Firstly, it provides legal recognition to the marriage, which is
        necessary for various legal and financial matters. Secondly, a marriage
        certificate is often required for visa applications, name changes, and
        for proving marital status in various legal and administrative
        situations. Our{" "}

        In India, marriage can be registered under two primary acts: The Hindu
        Marriage Act, 1955, and The Special Marriage Act, 1954. Each act has its
        own set of requirements and procedures. Our{" "}
