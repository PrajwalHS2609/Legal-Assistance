      <p>
        Negotiation is a fundamental component of Alternative Dispute Resolution
        (ADR) in Bangalore where parties engage directly with each other to
        settle their differences. Effective negotiation requires strong
        communication skills, strategic thinking, and an understanding of each
        party's interests and objectives. At M & M Associates, we provide expert
        negotiation services to help parties reach agreements without the need
        for formal ADR processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our negotiation services involve preparing strategies, facilitating
        discussions, and helping parties explore various options for settlement.
        We focus on finding common ground and creating solutions that address
        the concerns of all parties involved. This approach can lead to amicable
        resolutions and avoid the need for more formal dispute resolution
        methods.
