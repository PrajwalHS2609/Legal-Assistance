        Civil law encompasses a broad range of legal issues that arise between
        individuals, organizations, and government entities. Unlike criminal
        law, which deals with offenses against the state, civil law focuses on
        disputes that require resolution through compensation or other remedies.
        Our <a href="https://lawyersinbangalore.com/civil-lawyers-in-bangalore">civil lawyers in Bangalore</a> specialize in various aspects of civil
        law, ensuring that our clients receive well-rounded and thorough
