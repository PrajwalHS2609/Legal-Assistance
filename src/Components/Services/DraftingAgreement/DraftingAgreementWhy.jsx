          <p>
            ADR proceedings are usually private, unlike court cases which are
            often public. This confidentiality helps protect sensitive
            information and maintains the privacy of the parties involved.

          <p>
            ADR methods offer greater flexibility in terms of scheduling and
            procedure. Parties can tailor the process to suit their needs and
            preferences, leading to more customized and satisfactory outcomes.

          <p>
            ADR techniques, especially mediation, focus on finding mutually
            agreeable solutions and can help preserve professional and personal
            relationships that might otherwise be damaged through adversarial
            litigation.
