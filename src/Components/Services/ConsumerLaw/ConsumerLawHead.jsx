      <h2>Understanding Consumer Right</h2>{" "}
      <p>
        Consumer rights are a crucial aspect of a fair and transparent market.
        These rights are designed to protect consumers from exploitation,
        ensuring that they receive safe products, accurate information, and fair
        treatment. In India, consumer rights are enshrined in the Consumer
        Protection Act, 2019, which provides a legal framework for addressing
        grievances and disputes. Our Consumer Court Lawyers in Bangalore are
        well-versed in this legislation and are committed to upholding these
        rights for our clients.
