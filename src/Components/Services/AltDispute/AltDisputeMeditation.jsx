      <p>
        Mediation is a popular form of <a href="https://lawyersinbangalore/alternative-dispute-resolution-in-bangalore">Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in
        Bangalore</a> where a neutral third-party mediator facilitates communication
        between disputing parties to help them reach a voluntary agreement. At
        MM Associates, our skilled mediators are trained to handle a wide range
        of disputes, including family matters, business conflicts, and
        contractual issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mediation services aim to create a constructive environment where
        parties can openly discuss their issues and work towards a mutually
        acceptable resolution. The mediator's role is to guide the conversation,
        offer insights, and propose solutions, but the final agreement is
        reached by the parties themselves. This process fosters collaboration
        and can lead to creative solutions that might not be available through
        traditional litigation.
