      <p>
        Arbitration is another effective Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
        method in Bangalore, where disputes are resolved by an arbitrator or a
        panel of arbitrators. Unlike mediation, arbitration results in a binding
        decision that is enforceable in the same way as a court judgment. At M &
        M Associates, we offer comprehensive arbitration services to handle
        complex disputes involving business contracts, employment issues, and
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our arbitration services are designed to provide a fair and impartial
        resolution to disputes. We assist in selecting experienced arbitrators,
        preparing for hearings, and presenting evidence and arguments. Our goal
        is to ensure that the arbitration process is conducted efficiently and
        that the resulting decision is in line with the parties' agreements and
        legal requirements.
